wpftowerdefense
===============

A tower defense game created with WPF

A small side project of mine, provided for informational/educational use only.

Features include:

 A Hex grid (which I probably have you at)
 Automatic relative scrolling (use the zoom slider on the left)
 Heat as a gameplay mechanic (use 'Radiator's)

Free free to copy my techniques; but not my code.
